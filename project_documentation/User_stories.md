| Name                | Detect Object                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Description         | The camera needs to detect all objects in front of itself(that it has been trained to detect) accurately and correctly. |
| Pre-requisite state | Activated                                                    |
| Steps               | 1. Object(s) is/are placed in front of the camera.<br />2. Camera uses machine learned algorithm to analyse incoming stream of images.<br />3. Camera determines the amount of recognized objects. |
| End-state           | Camera now has a list of crudely recognized objects in front of itself. |
