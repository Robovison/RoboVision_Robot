# Project Plan

[TOC]

## Context

This document serves as the project plan for the Robovision project. It details the overall goals of this project, the different phases that will comprise the project and the order in which those phases will be executed. Each phase will be comprised of a description and a listing of the goals of the given phase. This, alongside some time organizing, serves the purpose of giving way of measuring the length of progress, as well as the quality/completeness of progress.

## Goals

The point of the Robovision project, succinctly speaking, is to get a robot arm to pickup and put down objects effectively from box A into box B using a depth camera that is cheaper than it's industrial-standard counterpart. It's a sort of experiment for both cheaper solutions in depth cameras, as well as a testing grounds for the ROS(Robot Operating System) development environment in more practical fields. To put this to a list, it would go like this:

- Make the robot arm work with ROS code.
- Make the cheaper depth camera work with ROS code.
- Pick up and put down items from one box to another, using a robot arm.
- Document the entirety of this project(code, workflow diagrams, etc.) for later continuation.
- Learn a bunch about ROS

## Phases

### Phase I

This project phase consists of the startup. Here the team primarily gets settled in, meets the project customer, discuss requirements, make documentation and prepare their work environment for ROS programming. Due to the nature of this project and the students working on it, this phase also includes a brief introduction into working with ROS. This phase's goals can be summarised as such:

- Collect all specifications and requirements about the project from the customer. Understand the status of the project and plan out work accordingly.
- Create all necessary standard project documentation.
  - Requirements list.
  - Project Plan.
  - Structure Diagrams.
  - Workflow Diagrams.
- Set up Ubuntu and ROS so that everyone can work with it.
- Learn about the basics of working with ROS. Everyone should understand how to create nodes in ROS and make them talk to each other via topics.
- Create project repository to have the skeleton of the project ready and a place to put all documentation.
- Organise a workflow for the team. Standardise work distribution, work planning, etc.

### Phase II

This phase will consist of the actual digging into the project.
