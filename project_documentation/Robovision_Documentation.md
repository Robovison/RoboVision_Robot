# Robovision Documentation

[TOC]

## Project Description

This document covers all of the documentation for the code-side of the Robovision project. This is a project, funded, supervised and assisted by GTL(GreenTech Labs) and Fontys HS in Venlo. The purpose of the project is to use ROS(Robot Operating System) to develop a system that uses conveyors, a robot arm and a depth camera to establish a working robot-object-sorting automated system. All of the documentation below goes into some detail about the nodes of the project, the general structure and the hardware components. The most of the actual documentation, however, can be found within the code of the respective nodes.
